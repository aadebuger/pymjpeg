A python mjpeg streamer

**Tester:** stream img/ by typing ```python server.py``` and point your browser to ```http://localhost:8001``` (except chome).

Chrome doesn't support displaying a multipart stream directly in the viewport. Firefox and Safari do it well. And every browser supports this in a ```<img>``` tag.
